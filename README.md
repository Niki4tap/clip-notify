# Clip notify
Plays a clip sound whenever you copy something into your clipboard.
Works only on linux-X11, not sure about supporting anything else at the moment.

## Compiling
It is highly recommended to compile this program in release mode,
as the `kira` library this program is using is very slow at 
parsing audio files in debug mode.
